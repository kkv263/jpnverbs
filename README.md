## Jpnverbs (Name is definitely subject to change)
Jpnverbs is an application that is supposed to serve as a verb conjugator for the Japanese language. It utilizes the JEDict file to parse for Japanese verbs, and formulates the conjugated forms of the words as well as a definition of the word. In the future I hope to add more features for a more fleshed out website. This website uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
